Methods to summarize data in hydrobasins

These methods were developed for a presentaton and IALE-NA in 2025, Raleigh North Carolina USA.

Results are posted on Data Basin and can be viewed in this gallery, 

"Fire characteristics (1985-2022) and environments in the North American Cordillera: southwestern United States and northern Mexico"

2. fire_metrics_hydrosheds.R: summaries of fire characteristics within the level 8 hydrobasins
3. roadless_volume.R: summaries of RV values in level 8 hydrobasins
4. anthrome_landscape_metrics.R: calculate configuration of anthome classes in hydrobasin polys using the landscapemetrics library in R: https://r-spatialecology.github.io/landscapemetrics/articles/irregular_areas.html
5. study area polysons for the three ecoregions: "Final_CASC_studyarea.shp" (zipfile)
6. hydrobasins, level 8: https://www.hydrosheds.org/products/hydrobasins

Including:
1. Fire perimeters for three ecoregions of southwestern US and Sierra Madre Norte
2. Anthopogenic biomes (derived from population, vegetation type and land use)
3. Roadless volume (a measure of remoteness)
